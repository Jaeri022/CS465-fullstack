# CS465-fullstack

In this project, the webpage being developed used a MEAN stack, refering to each part of the stack
M- MongoDB, which in this case used a NoSQL database to handle the JSON data being passed through more effeciently compared to it's SQL counterpart.
E - Express, which in this case handled the handlebars being used to display the html files using Node javascript
A- Angular, which in this case was responsible for the front-end development of the page and handling the SPA framework
N- Node, the back-end handling the javascript files.

JSON and Javascript differs in the fact that the data type in JSON is left ambiguious for the files to use, the data being easily transferred between api to be read, while javascript defines the data and models used. In terms of testing endpoints, a method would be to test the endpoints in the browser after starting a server, such as retriving the trip data. Another way would be to test the endpoints using Postman, using the forms to test the functionality of data such as the security and trip forms.

This course helped in my future goals of becoming a software engineer by teqaching me the basics of all aspects in making a web page, going through what is required on both the front and back ends of the application. Learning the MEAN stack, SPA functionality, and security measures will help me expand my knowledge in the future more in depth for each of these aspects.
